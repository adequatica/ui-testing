# UI Testing with TypeScript and Playwright

[![Run Playwright Tests](https://github.com/adequatica/ui-testing/actions/workflows/run-playwright-tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/adequatica/ui-testing/actions/workflows/run-playwright-tests.yaml)

## Stack

A basic set of packages to test UI with TypeScript:

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) — testing framework;
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) — code formatter;
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) — code linter.

Example website for testing as a default `baseURL`: [CERN](https://home.cern), unless otherwise specified.

## How to Use

1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Install dependencies for testing framework: `npm run test:install-deps`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

### CLI Options

- Different tested host could be passed to tests through .env variable:

```
BASE_URL=https://home.cern npm test
```

- Run tests [filtered by tag](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests):

```
npm test -- --grep @mobile
```

- Run a single test (for example: `switch-language.spec.ts`):

```
npm test tests/switch-language.spec.ts
```

Or:

```
npm test -- --grep language
```

- Run tests in [debug mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#pwdebug):

```
npm test -- --debug --grep language
```

Or through the custom command:

```
npm run test:debug -- --grep language
```

## Examples of Test Cases

All tests are synthetic and written in different «styles» and approaches with the intent to demonstrate various cases from the articles [Hidden Gems of Playwright](https://adequatica.github.io/2022/09/07/hidden-gems-of-playwright.html) and [Part 2](https://adequatica.github.io/2024/05/23/hidden-gems-of-playwright-part-2.html), unless otherwise specified:
